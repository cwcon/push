# The world’s shortest CFP

If you or your students write in plain text and there’s some computer language and rhetorical
theory or princples involved, *Push* wants to help you develop and publish an openly reviewed
article about it.

*And that’s the Push CFP. Below are a few more details.*

## Two Guiding Principles

1. **Source is source.** Whether you’re writing with source for markup, design, or full-on scripting
and programming, write up your work and submit it to *Push*.

2. **Don’t let your experience level get in the way.** Maybe you’ve gained insights from your
very first time teaching HTML. Or maybe you have a radically new perspective for approaching a
writing task with the assistance of an entire language or framework. *Push* seeks submissions by
writers with all levels of experience working with source code.

## Basic Article Guidelines

All article submissions to *Push* should be:

* 1500-2500 words + references and source examples
* Written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
* Compliant with the *Chicago Manual of Style*, 16th ed., including for
  [footnote citations](/learn/style-guide.html#footnotes_and_citation)
* Tracked in Git on a dedicated `submission` branch in your copy of the repository
* Submitted as a pull request on GitHub

See the [setup guide](/learn/) and the [style guide](/learn/style-guide.html) for more information.

## Queries Prior to Writing & Submitting

If you want feedback on an idea before you write,
[open a new issue](https://github.com/cwcon/push/issues/new) on GitHub and write `QUERY:`
at the beginning of the title for your query.
