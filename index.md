# Introducing Push

*Push* is a journal dedicated to publishing original research on writing with source code.

## Mission

*Push*’s mission is:

* **to help develop writers and researchers working with source code**, both through the published
  [issues](/issues/) of the journal and the active, open process by which submissions are reviewed
  and improved on the road to publication;
* **to advocate for individuals working to incorporate source-level writing** into their research,
  classrooms, and professional development;
* and most of all, **to improve the sophistication of digital writers** writing in a
  software-neutral, source-level way.

## A Different Approach to Open Access Publishing

To reinforce its mission and focus, the journal and the means by which people
[contribute](/contribute/) rely on open technologies of source-level writing. The entirety of *Push*
is openly available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push) containing every line of
source code, every submission and issue. There are absolutely no secrets here, and everything is
open for public review and improvement.

And in stark contrast to the heavy, database-driven systems behind other digital journals, *Push* is
just a humble collection of HTML files, compiled from Markdown source, pushed out to GitHub as the
pages you’re looking at here. [Lo-Fi](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/12.3/topoi/stolley/) all the
way.

## Help Wanted: Yours

So, let’s get started. Read a bit more [about](/about/) the journal. Check out the initial [blog
posts](/blog/) on the genesis and development of *Push*. Glance at the [CFP](cfp.md), which is
quite possibly the world’s shortest. And then learn how you can [contribute](/contribute/) to *Push*
and help build a journal that will push the applied theory & practice of digital writing radically
forward.
