# People

Right now, this page is pretty empty. But your name belongs here, if you’re willing to help out.
Want in? [Contribute to Push](/contribute/). The first time you submit a pull request, be sure to
add your name to the contributors list below.

#### No gods, no mastheads

For the time being, everyone’s a contributor. No editors, no advisory-board members, and no
granting of titles based on a reputation built elsewhere. Titles will be earned, not granted, as
decided by other *Push* contributors.

But that stuff doesn’t matter. We need to [build this thing](/contribute/) first.
