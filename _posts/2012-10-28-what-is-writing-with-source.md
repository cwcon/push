              Kevin Brock is a Ph.D. candidate in Communication, Rhetoric, and 
              Digital Media at North Carolina State University. His work
              primarily focuses on the space shared by rhetoric and the
              critical studies of software and code, with a special interest in
              how code (as both practice and text) functions as a rhetorically
              powerful and significant form of contemporary communication. His
              dissertation in progress is titled “Engaging the Action-oriented
              Nature of Computation: Towards a Rhetorical Code Studies.”

## What is (or could be) “writing with source” and who does it affect?

I’ve been excited to see the different communities that have responded to the
announcement for _Push_: programmers, net artists, writers, and scholars in
fields such as rhetoric, information design, technical communication, and 
computer science. 

As an academic interested in the overlap of rhetoric and software development, 
I was eager enough when I saw the initial announcement for _Push_ that I spent 
the day preparing a submission to its first issue. It’s probably not surprising 
that someone like me would jump at the chance to contribute to a journal 
dedicated to “research & applied theory in writing with source.” But since 
there are so many ways that this phrase could be read, I thought it also might 
help to clarify some of the ways that “writing with source” could apply to 
interested parties and, just maybe, spur a little more interest in the journal 
and its potential.

Below, I’ll highlight _some_ of the contributions that I recognize different 
groups being able to offer both _Push_ and the other communities whose interest 
and investment in writing with source. This is hardly exhaustive, but my goal 
is to help spur further interest in what _Push_ __could be__ rather than to
define what it _is_ or _should be_.

## Some Interested/Invested Communities

### 1. Software Developers

Practitioners in software and new media are perhaps the most “obvious” set of 
communities, since they’re regularly working directly in code languages in 
order to _make stuff happen_ through computational means. The sheer variety of 
ways that we can do this, from choice of language to individual stylistic 
preference, offers us a chance to explore _why_ we want to write in code as we 
do. Some questions that may be of interest here include:

* What do we decide to add in comments? 
* What do we think “speaks for itself” in particular functions and operations? 
* How do we argue for/against particular practices?
* How does our work demonstrate its own “character” versus practical or efficient functionality?

### 2. Artists

A similar set of communities is that of the various artists that work in source 
to experiment with the possibilities of code and data. Where software 
developers might be primarily interested in creating a program in order to 
facilitate some particular task, artists might instead draw attention to our 
preconceptions of how software “should” work so that we might question why we 
accept certain paradigms or value systems over others (put differently, _why_ 
we choose to make stuff happen). Of historical interest are net artists such as 
[JODI](http://jodi.org) and [mez](http://netwurkerz.de/mez/datableed/complete/) 
and “functional” code texts like ["Black Perl"](http://internet.ls-la.net/comppoems/black-perl.html). 

### 3. Scholars

Academics—such as those in rhetoric and composition, software studies, 
and critical code studies—are in a unique position to explore the 
critical, cultural, and semiotic significance of code/source as a meaningful 
form of communication and action. _Action_ is particularly important here, to 
build on the term as used by 20th century rhetorician Kenneth Burke: we 
communicate with one another not just to exchange ideas and information but in 
order to _make stuff happen_ (e.g., persuading someone to change his or her 
mind; instigating a riot; honoring a departed loved one). Seeing what sort of 
meaningful action is possible through source could serve as an inquiry into how 
we try (or don’t try!) to persuade one another in code to act certain ways or 
to believe in certain systems/structures/etc.

## Just a Beginning

Of course, what I’ve described above is just the tip of the iceberg, and even 
as I write this, it’s been less than 48 hours since the journal went live. I 
know that I’m unable to acknowledge here all of the substantial ways that 
different folks could contribute to the journal _and_ to the interdisciplinary 
conversation(s) surrounding the exigence of its creation. My hope is that 
specific descriptions of potential theoretical and applied approaches, such as 
those hinted at above, might help make _Push_ even more of a reality.
